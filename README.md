# Fractal_Learn 🌿

**Fractal_Learn** is an educational Python project designed to explore **fractal mathematics**
through **visual and recursive coding**.  
The project focuses on generating a **Fractal Tree**, showing how simple mathematical rules
can create complex, natural-looking structures.

## 📖 Introduction

Fractals are mathematical patterns that repeat at different scales.
They are widely observed in nature, such as:
- Trees and plants
- River networks
- Clouds and mountains
- Blood vessels and lungs

This project helps learners understand how **mathematics, logic, and programming**
come together to model such patterns using Python.

🌳 How the Fractal Tree Works (Simple Explanation)
The program starts with a single trunk
Each branch:
Splits into two smaller branches

# 🌳 Fractal Tree Mathematical Model (Python)

A Python-based implementation of a **fractal tree** using recursive algorithms to demonstrate the application of **fractal mathematics** and **computational thinking** in STEM learning.

---

## 🌳 Working Principle

This project models a **fractal tree structure** using recursion.

The algorithm starts with a **single trunk**.  
At each recursive step, every branch:

- Splits into **two smaller branches**
- Rotates by a **fixed angle**
- Scales down in length using a **constant ratio**
- Repeats the same logic recursively

The recursion terminates when the branch length falls below a defined minimum limit.

Through repeated application of simple mathematical rules, the program generates a **complex, self-similar tree structure**, illustrating the fundamentals of fractal geometry.

---

## 📐 Parameters Used

The appearance and complexity of the fractal tree are controlled by the following parameters:

- **Angle**  
  Controls the divergence and spread of branches.

- **Length Ratio**  
  Determines how much shorter each new branch becomes.

- **Depth / Minimum Length Limit**  
  Restricts recursion and controls the overall size of the tree.

By modifying these parameters, multiple unique fractal tree structures can be generated.
