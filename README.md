# Fractal_Learn 🌿

**Fractal_Learn** is an educational Python project designed to explore **fractal mathematics**
through **visual and recursive coding**.  
The project focuses on generating a **Fractal Tree**, showing how simple mathematical rules
can create complex, natural-looking structures.

## 📖 Introduction

Fractals are mathematical patterns that repeat at different scales.
They are widely observed in nature, such as:
- Trees and plants
- River networks
- Clouds and mountains
- Blood vessels and lungs

This project helps learners understand how **mathematics, logic, and programming**
come together to model such patterns using Python.
