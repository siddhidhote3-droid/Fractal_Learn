# Fractal_Learn 🌿

**Fractal_Learn** is an educational Python project designed to explore **fractal mathematics**
through **visual and recursive coding**.  
The project focuses on generating a **Fractal Tree**, showing how simple mathematical rules
can create complex, natural-looking structures.

## 📖 Introduction

Fractals are mathematical patterns that repeat at different scales.
They are widely observed in nature, such as:
- Trees and plants
- River networks
- Clouds and mountains
- Blood vessels and lungs

This project helps learners understand how **mathematics, logic, and programming**
come together to model such patterns using Python.

🌳 How the Fractal Tree Works (Simple Explanation)
The program starts with a single trunk
Each branch:
Splits into two smaller branches
Turns by a fixed angle
Reduces its length by a fixed ratio
This process repeats recursively
The recursion stops when the branch length becomes very small
This simple rule creates a complex tree-like structure.
📐 Parameters Used
Angle: Controls how wide the branches spread
Ratio: Controls how much shorter each new branch becomes
Depth / Length limit: Controls the size of the tree
By changing these values, different tree shapes can be created.
📷 Output
The repository includes screenshots showing the generated fractal tree. Each image represents the visual output of the mathematical model.
